# UMG Research Report

## Introduction
The University Medical Center Groningen (UMG) is committed to advancing medical research and improving patient care through innovative approaches and technologies.

## Key Findings
1. Patient outcomes improved by 27% following the implementation of the new treatment protocol.
2. Research funding increased by €3.2 million compared to the previous fiscal year.
3. Collaborative projects with international partners grew by 42%.

## Methodology
Our research employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative interviews and focus groups.

## Results
The results indicate a significant correlation between early intervention and positive patient outcomes. Specifically, patients who received treatment within 24 hours showed a 35% better recovery rate than those with delayed treatment.

## Conclusion
Based on our findings, we recommend implementing the new protocol across all departments and continuing to monitor outcomes over the next 12 months.`

- HbA1c levels between 7.0% and 10.0%
- BMI between 25 and 40 kg/m²

## Exclusion Criteria
- Pregnancy or breastfeeding
- History of cardiovascular events within the past 6 months
- Current use of insulin therapy
- Participation in another clinical trial within the past 30 days

## Primary Endpoints
1. Change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24
2. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events

## Secondary Endpoints
1. Change in fasting plasma glucose
2. Change in body weight
3. Patient-reported outcomes using the Diabetes Quality of Life questionnaire`

For DOCX files, we might use mammoth.js or docx-parser.

The extracted text would then be processed and indexed for retrieval.`
